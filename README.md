## Description

This is a really small addon that adds the option to display the current WoW token price in your region. It should be compatible with any addon that has the DataText option like ElvUI, TitanPanel, Bagnon or Bazooka.

### Do you prefer a more vanilla style, without too many addons?

Maybe you'd be interested in my other addon, [WoW Token Price Display](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/wow-token-price-display).
